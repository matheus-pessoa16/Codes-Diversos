# CHATBOT - C++ ![CI status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen.svg)

This is a chatbot written in C++ for study purposes. This project is based on the "Chatbot Tutorial", that you can find here: https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/36106/Chatbot-Tutorial. I made modifications in some data structures just to test other options. 

## Installation

### Requirements
* Linux
* C++ compiler (Recommended: G++).

`$ make`

## Usage

Just execute file inside the build/apps directory and start to talk. This version is limited, but continous improvements are been made.

## Modifications

Now the database is larger than before and we started to use OOP to modularization of the code. 

## Contributing
